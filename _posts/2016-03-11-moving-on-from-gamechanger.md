Today is my last day working at GameChanger in NYC. It's a sad day because over the last 3½ years GameChanger has been a thrilling place to be, filled with incredibly smart, driven people and interesting, innovative ideas.

I owe a huge debt of gratitude to everyone I've worked with at GameChanger for making me better in so many ways, in particular to Kiril Savino, Ted Sullivan and Phil Sarin. I'd go so far as to say that I've learned more in the last 3½ years than I had in the previous 7. This is the place where I've done the best work of my career.

I've been very lucky to work for people who have actively encouraged me to go out and learn about the best ideas in the industry and have entrusted me with the freedom to apply them. I can't emphasize enough how instrumental it has been to my personal growth to have been given that agency over my work.

I also had the opportunity work on a product which has empowered amateur sports coaches, encouraged kids and adults to participate in healthy, character-building activities and allowed communities to connect around a common interest. Over the years we've received amazing, often poignant feedback from customers: a soldier deployed overseas marveling at being able to follow his daughter's softball game live on GameChanger, a dedicated coach getting excited about being able to better develop his players using data. It's been a privilege to work on a product which has resonated so deeply with so many people.

The time has now come for me to seek a fresh challenge. Thanks to everyone who has made this the special place it is and for a great 3½ years, I'll miss you all.
