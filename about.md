I'm a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience building software systems for customers around the world. I like to work on challenging problems which involve technology, people and delivering real customer value.

I work at GameChanger Media in NYC on everything from building scalable distributed systems architectures to building scalable engineering teams.

In my spare time I'm a long-suffering Tottenham Hotspur fan, I ski whenever possible, cook breakfast like a champion and embark on the occasional DIY project.

Originally from the UK, I have lived all over the planet and believe in the value of diverse perspectives.

I write about topics which interest me, of which there are many.
