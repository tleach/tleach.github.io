I'm a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience building software systems for customers around the world. I like to work on challenging problems which involve technology, people and delivering real customer value.

I work at [GameChanger](http://gc.com) in New York City as VP Technology. We build innovative tools and compelling experiences for the amateur sports market which help teams, players, families and communities to stay connected. I spend my time on everything from building scalable distributed systems architectures to building scalable engineering teams.

In my spare time I'm a long-suffering [Tottenham Hotspur](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/) fan, I ski whenever possible, read mostly non-fiction, cook breakfast like a champion and embark on the occasional DIY project.

Originally from the UK, I have lived all over the planet and believe in the value of diverse perspectives and always being willing to challenge one's own ideas.

I write about topics which interest me, of which there are many.

Spelling and grammar is unapologetically British.
